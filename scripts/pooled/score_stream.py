"""Stitch pooled ONE-NAS per-generation predictions into a daily stream and score it.

Reads generation_<g>_global_best.csv files from a sliding-window pooled run,
maps each file row to a panel date via the sidecar panel_dates.csv, keeps only
the newest `step` rows of each generation (consecutive windows overlap), and
computes:

  1. Daily cross-sectional Pearson IC and Spearman rank IC (mean, SE, t-stat).
  2. Multi-horizon rank IC h=1..10 vs forward cumulative real returns.
  3. A daily long-short book, in one of two constructions (--book):
       algo1   (default) the ICAIF Algorithm 1 -- top-10 long / bottom-10
               short, rebalanced only when all top-10 preds > 0 and all
               bottom-10 < 0, else held;
       sleeves Jegadeesh-Titman overlapping portfolios -- one new sleeve every
               day, held exactly --hold-days days, 1/H of capital per side;
     both with per-trade costs of TC/PRC on *netted* traded notional.
  4. Naive-persistence baselines of 1 and 3.

Realized series (--realized, see below):
  The model may be TRAINED on a transformed target -- e.g. --param RET_CS, a
  per-date cross-sectional rank-normal transform of the next-day return.  The
  expected_<param>_s<k> columns of the prediction files then hold rank-normal
  scores, NOT returns, and using them as the realized series would make the
  long-short book's P&L and the multi-horizon cumulative returns meaningless.

  The v2 panels therefore carry the untransformed next-day simple returns in
  the sidecar as RET_raw_<TICKER> columns of panel_dates.csv, in the same
  sorted-ticker order as PRC_/TC_.  When they are present (--realized auto, the
  default) they are the realized series for EVERY metric -- Pearson IC, rank
  IC, multi-horizon rank IC and the book -- and the expected_<param> columns
  are used only to verify the file-row -> panel-row mapping.  Older panels
  (set*_clean) have no RET_raw_ columns; there the expected_<param> columns are
  the realized series, exactly as before.

  Note the predicted/naive SIGNALS always stay in <param> units: they only ever
  get sorted and rank-correlated, and --book algo1's rebalance trigger tests
  their sign, which a rank-normal transform preserves.

Scale invariance (--book sleeves):
  The Algorithm 1 trigger reads the LEVEL of the predictions, so it is not
  invariant to rescaling them.  Under a cross-sectional rank-normal target
  (--param RET_CS) the models emit rank-normal scores whose signs flip roughly
  half the names every day, the trigger fires nearly every day, and turnover
  explodes -- the trigger ends up measuring the signal's scale, not its
  content.  --book sleeves uses nothing but the cross-sectional ORDER of the
  predictions, so its net %, Sharpe, MDD, turnover and cost % are identical
  under any strictly monotone per-day rescaling of the signal.

Row mapping (VERIFIED EMPIRICALLY, see verify_mapping()):
  Generation g has clock window cw = g + num_training_windows and test window
  tw = cw + V.  The input window starts at panel row tw*step + 1 (NOT tw*step),
  and with --time_offset 1 the L-1 file rows are targets for panel rows
      tw*step + 2 + i          for file row i in [0, L-1)
  i.e. an offset of +2 from tw*step, one more than the naive derivation
  (window start tw*step, targets tw*step + 1 + i).  The offset is detected and
  re-verified at startup against the per-stock CSVs in the sidecar dir by
  matching the expected_<param>_s<k> columns to the stock's real column.
  Stock s<k> is the k-th ticker in sorted order of the sidecar CSV filenames,
  which also matches the PRC_/TC_ column order in panel_dates.csv (verified).

Each generation contributes its newest `step` file rows, indices
(L-1-step)..(L-2); coverage across generations is asserted contiguous.

Book accounting: $100 base capital, $100 long + $100 short notional
(equal-weight, $100/top_k per name).  A rebalance moves the book to the new
target weights and costs are charged on the NETTED change in each name's
notional, not on a full liquidate-and-rebuild: a name that stays on the same
side at the same target weight only pays for its drift, a name that flips
long->short pays the full round trip, a name that leaves the book pays to be
closed.  Cost fraction per unit traded notional is TC/PRC priced at the
previous panel row (= trade at prior close), or a flat one-way --cost-bps.
Positions accrue that same day's realized return.  Daily net return is
(P&L - costs) / initial $100 capital, so cumulative net % is additive.

--book sleeves: every day forms ONE new sleeve -- top_k long / bottom_k short
by that day's cross-sectional prediction rank, $100/H per side and hence
($100/H)/top_k per name -- and retires the sleeve formed H days earlier.  At
steady state H sleeves are live, so the aggregate book is again $100 long +
$100 short and 1/H of it rolls each day.  The traded notional and the cost are
computed on the change in the AGGREGATE position per name, so a name held by
several live sleeves is never double-traded; the same netted TC/PRC (or
--cost-bps) pricing at the previous panel row applies.  Every live sleeve
accrues that day's realized return and drifts with it, exactly as algo1's book
does.  There is no trigger and no threshold: only the rank ordering is read.

--beta-neutral: scales the SHORT leg by s = beta(long leg) / beta(short leg)
so the book's ex-ante exposure to the panel's equal-weight mean return is ~0.
Per-stock betas are OLS slopes against that equal-weight mean over the
--beta-window (default 60) panel rows STRICTLY BEFORE the formation day, so
the construction stays causal.  Under --book sleeves the scale is applied per
sleeve at its own formation day; under --book algo1 it is applied to the
aggregate target book at each rebalance.  s is clipped to [0.2, 5] and falls
back to 1.0 when either leg's summed beta is non-positive or the window holds
fewer than 20 usable rows.  The book is then no longer exactly $100/$100:
turnover stays normalised by the nominal $200 gross so it stays comparable.
