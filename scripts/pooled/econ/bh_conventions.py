"""Buy & hold over 2020-2024 under both conventions, with risk stats.

The paper's window table currently reports buy & hold on the prior study's
convention (raw PRC: no dividends, no split adjustment).  Over the window
that table used, 2022-2024, that row is small.  Over the full registered
evaluation span it is not, so the two conventions need to be side by side
with the risk that produced them.

  prior   raw PRC price return, no dividends, no split adjustment.  This is
          the published benchmark convention and it is the one whose split
          handling ICAIF_BENCH_NOTE.md documents as a defect.
  total   panel RET (split- and dividend-adjusted), the same realized-return
          series every model arm is scored against.
